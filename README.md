This is a demo project, created as a part of the [blog post](http://agilevision.pl/blog/serverless%20architecture/2017/02/12/easily-create-complex-workflows-with-aws-step-functions.html).
The project uses **serverless** for deployments.

# Setup

Be sure to adjust bucket names and the email address inside the **serverless.yml**!
